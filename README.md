##### `header` (Object)

The document header.

###### Keys

- `version`: The version number of the json structure.

- `context_id`: A v4 UUID of the drawing context. Can also be used as an ID for the drawing itself.

- `count`: The total number of `drawings` in the file

##### `drawings` (Array)

The individual drawings that make up this document.

##### `drawing` (Object)

The actual drawing object that is contained in the `drawings` array.

###### Keys

- `drawing_id`: A v4 UUID.

- `version`: The version of the JSON structure.

- `smoothing`: The smoothing rate that should be used when drawing this path. (Catmullâ€“Rom spline granularity)

- `size`: The canvas size for the drawing. All drawings coordinate system is from the top left corner.

- `count`: Number of points in this drawing.

- `meta`: Additional information about the drawing.

- `tool`: The tool used to create this drawing.

- `points`: An array of point objects.

- `isCulled`: A bool indicating if the drawing should be culled from the render tree.

##### `point` (Object)

An individual point in the drawing.

###### Keys

- `force`: A number representing the amount of force used when creating this point. (Default 1)

- `isPredictive`: This point was generated as a prediction of where the user was drawing. Created by the system. (The drawing document shouldn't contain any `true` predictive points).

- `previous`: (Object) A reference to the previous location. If it's the first point in the drawing this will be the same as `location`. This is stored for drawing performance reasons.

  - `x`: The X location of the previous point.

  - `y`: The y location of the previous point.

- `location`:

  - `x`: The x location of the point.

  - `y`: The y location of the point.

##### `tool` (Object)

The tool used to create this drawing.

- `force`: The force cap of the tool.

- `name`: The name of the tool. (Tool Type)

- `version`: The version of the JSON structure.

- `lineWidth`: How wide the line should be drawn.
